## 🎯 Learning Approach

1. **Understand, don't memorize** - Focus on why, not just what
2. **Build, then learn** - Code first, understand deeply after
3. **Real-world practice** - Every concept applied to data science scenarios
4. **Daily consistency** - One commit per day, even if small progress
5. **Document learnings** - Notes for future reference and interviews

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Focus Areas:** Data science, pandas, data cleaning, ML preparation

## 📚 Learning Resources

- Introduction to Python coursework
- StatQuest (YouTube) - Concept explanations
- Real Python - Practical tutorials
- Python Official Documentation

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

This repository documents my transition into data science. Each commit represents:
- A new concept learned
- A problem solved
- Progress toward job readiness

**Note:** This is a learning repository. You'll see my progression from basic concepts to complex implementations. The goal is growth, not perfection.
